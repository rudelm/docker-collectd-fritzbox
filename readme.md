# Docker container with collectd configured to collect data from Fritzbox
This docker container is a preconfigured collectd with installed fritzcollectd. I use it on my Synology DS218+ to gather longterm connection statistics of my Fritzbox.


```
Attention: This used to work until AVM released FritzOS 7.28. With this version, this docker container was unable to gather the Data from the Fritzbox.
```

This repo and its docker container on docker hub aren't maintained anymore. I'm now using a different approach, see [fritzinfluxdb](https://github.com/rudelm/fritzinfluxdb).

## Setup
- Install docker
- Pull the latest image from the Docker registry:
```
docker pull rudelm/collectd-fritzbox
```

- Create a user in Fritzbox used by collectd so that the TR-069 interface can be queried:

```
Now create a user account in the Fritz!Box for collectd. Go to System, Fritz!Box-user and create a new user with password, who has access from internet disabled. The important part is to enable „Fritz!Box settings“.

Additionally make sure that your Fritz!Box is configured to support connection queries using UPnP. You can configure this under „Home Network > Network > Networksettings“. Select „Allow access for applications“ as well as „Statusinformation using UPnP“.
```

## Usage
### Start the container manually:
Be aware that this will leave your used credentials in your bash history! It might be better to use the docker-compose version.
```
docker run -d -e EP_HOST=example.com -e EP_PORT=2003 -e FRITZ_IP=192.168.178.1 -e FRITZ_PASSWORD=<yourpassword> rudelm/collectd-fritzbox
```

### Start the container using the `docker-compose.yml`:
- Modify the environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`according to your setup
- Rename or copy `collectd.env.template` to `collectd.env` and fill it according to your setup
```
docker-compose up
```
- collectd will now be available on your host in the exposed port `25826`.

### Usage with influxdb
I intend to use this container with influxdb so you should use the content from `docker-compose.yml` to setup several container which can be started with a single docker-compose up command.

- Modify the environment variables in `docker-compose.influx.yml` according to your setup
- Rename or copy `collectd.env.template` to `collectd.env` and fill it according to your setup
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.influx.yml up
```

I do not expose the port `25825`on the collectd container since influxdb will connect to the collectd container on that port inside the docker network.  I'm not using collectd directly from my docker host, as I'm using influxdb to collect the data from collectd.

#### Running on Synology NAS
Please be aware that I'm using this file on a Synology DS218+, so I've mapped some folders to the volume1 of my NAS and placed files from this repo inside (e.g. the `collectd.env`, `docker-compose.influx.yml`, `ìnfluxdb.conf`, `types.db`).

If you want to run the container permamently, you'll need to use the `-d` option:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.influx.yml up -d
```

#### Mapping of collectd values to influxdb using types.db
You've might wonder about the `types.db`. It is taken from the collectd installation and must be present for influxdb, so that influx knows how it should map the values from collectd.
